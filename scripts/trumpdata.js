Oberon is complicated.</p><p>  What can be said about Oberon without interpretation is that those not of royal blood within the court of Amber are terrified of him. He was ruthless enough to win wars that the subjugated are still trying to understand how they could have possibly lost.

The natural goods that St. Arsbury trades to Amber are of significant value, however. Furs and pelts from the shadow are plentiful and in exceedingly high demand across the golden circle for their unparalleled quality. Many of the lumber products shipped from Weirmonken are prized for the variety of colors and use in craftsman goods. These raw materials have been a boon in recent years as many rebuild showings of wealth in the wake of the Red Rebellion.</p><p>The newly minted Count of St. Arsbury is Chester Wellington, who received the title after the death of his father at the hands of Weir assassins.</p>",
